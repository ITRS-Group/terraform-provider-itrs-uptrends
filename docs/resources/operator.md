# operator (Resource)

## Example usage

```terraform
# Manage an operator.
resource "operator" "operator123" {
  provider          = itrs-uptrends.uptrendsauthenticated
  backup_email      = ""
  default_dashboard = "UseAccountSpecifiedDashboard"
  email             = "operatoremail@email.com"
  full_name         = "Operator Name"
  is_on_duty        = true
  mobile_phone      = ""
  password_wo       = var.operator_password
  operator_role     = "Unspecified"
  sms_provider      = "UseAccountSetting"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `backup_email` (String) Backup email address for the operator. 
- `default_dashboard` (String) Default dashboard for the operator. 
- `email` (String) Primary email address for the operator. 
- `full_name` (String) Full name of the operator. 
- `is_on_duty` (Boolean) Whether the operator is currently on duty. 
- `mobile_phone` (String) Mobile phone number for the operator. 

### Optional

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the operator. 
- `is_account_administrator` (Boolean) Whether the operator is an account administrator. 
- `operator_role` (String) Role assigned to the operator. 
- `password_wo` (String, Sensitive) Password for the operator. Write-only field, not stored in state. Required during creation, optional during updates. 
- `sms_provider` (String) SMS provider for the operator. 

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# Operator can be imported by specifying the unique identifier.
terraform import operator.operator123 "046a727c-7a90-4776-9e41-ab050bdda5dc"
```

## Notes

- The `password_wo` field is **required during creation** but **optional during updates**.
- The `password_wo` field is write-only and sensitive - it will not be stored in the Terraform state.
- When creating an operator, a default operator authorization of 'AccountAccess' is automatically created.
- The `operator_role` field defaults to "Unspecified" if not provided.
- The `is_account_administrator` field is computed and managed by the Uptrends platform.
- All operators require a valid email address for notifications.

## Default operator authorization

When you create an operator, it automatically receives a default operator authorization of 'AccountAccess'. After creation, you will see a warning in your Terraform output containing an import block that you can copy and paste into your configuration to manage this authorization as a separate resource:

```terraform
import {
  to = operator_authorization.default_authorization_for_OPERATOR_ID
  id = "OPERATOR_ID:AccountAccess"
  provider = itrs-uptrends.uptrendsauthenticated
}
```
